error :

No transform between base_footprint and base_link
No transform between base_footprint and odom

[ WARN] [1539179068.598024979, 428.251000000]: Timed out waiting for transform from base_footprint to map to become 
available before running costmap, tf error: canTransform: target_frame map does not exist.. canTransform returned after 
428.251 timeout was 0.1.


cause for the error:

robot_state_publisher package 


Solution:


robot_state_publisher package not lauched are lauched wrongly

"rosrun tf view_frames"  to view the transformation of the link

"rosrun tf tf_echo base_footprint base_link"

"rosrun tf tf_monitor base_footprint base_link"

important 

compare the frames.pdf created with this command "rosrun tf view_frames" 

if the odom was not published 

then go to the urdf change gazebo plug in odom topic  name with slash before '/odom' or '/diff_odom'
